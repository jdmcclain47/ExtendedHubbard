- find the source of error in creating the MO fock integrals
   o can't converge density matrix to below 1e-14 for most systems
   o error in fock integrals computed with MO's and those computed with SCF are ~1e-12
   x might be due to small errors in the translation vectors and atomic positions
     - could possibly use more decimal accuracy in POSCAR file
     - could possibly "enforce" periodicity by checking the atomic positions and seeing
       whether "equivalent" atoms actually have equivalent distances up to machine accuracy
- sometimes DIIS converges to a shitty "solution", that is not in fact a solution...
   x might be due to singular DIIS matrices in code
